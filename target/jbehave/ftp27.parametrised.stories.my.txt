Scenario: A scenario for check temperature table
Examples:
Given a patient is <patient>
When patient temperature is <temperature>
Then temperature is <result>

|patient|temperature|result|
|1|38.0|low|
|1|39.0|normal|
|1|39.8|high|
|2|40.0|low|
|2|42.2|low|
|2|43.8|high|
|3|35.2|low|
|3|36.6|high|
|3|38.0|high|

Example: {patient=1, temperature=38.0, result=low}
Given a patient is 1
When patient temperature is 38.0
Then temperature is low

Example: {patient=1, temperature=39.0, result=normal}
Given a patient is 1
When patient temperature is 39.0
Then temperature is normal

Example: {patient=1, temperature=39.8, result=high}
Given a patient is 1
When patient temperature is 39.8
Then temperature is high

Example: {patient=2, temperature=40.0, result=low}
Given a patient is 2
When patient temperature is 40.0
Then temperature is low

Example: {patient=2, temperature=42.2, result=low}
Given a patient is 2
When patient temperature is 42.2
Then temperature is low (FAILED)
(org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[low]> but was:<[normal]>)

Example: {patient=2, temperature=43.8, result=high}
Given a patient is 2
When patient temperature is 43.8
Then temperature is high

Example: {patient=3, temperature=35.2, result=low}
Given a patient is 3
When patient temperature is 35.2
Then temperature is low

Example: {patient=3, temperature=36.6, result=high}
Given a patient is 3
When patient temperature is 36.6
Then temperature is high (FAILED)
(org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[high]> but was:<[normal]>)

Example: {patient=3, temperature=38.0, result=high}
Given a patient is 3
When patient temperature is 38.0
Then temperature is high
